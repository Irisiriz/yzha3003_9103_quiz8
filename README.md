## Imaging Technique Inspiration
> The imaging technique I found is **Double Exposure**. This method overlays two distinct images to create an abstract visual effect. The main image will be the geometric lines and structures of the chosen artwork, while the overlay image will incorporate abstract patterns or natural elements like waves or trees. I think this technique is beneficial for our assignment because it allows us to represent both structural design and organic forms simultaneously, highlighting contrasts and deeper symbolism. It also provides a unique way to explore the artwork's composition, adding layers of meaning and visual interest.
